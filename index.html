            <h3 id ="headline">Percy Julian Biography</h3>
            <p class="biography">Percy Lavon Julian was an African American research chemist and a pioneer in the chemical synthesis of
                medicinal drugs from
                plants. He was the first to synthesize the natural product physostigmine, and a pioneer in the
                industrial large-scale chemical synthesis of the human hormones progesterone and testosterone from plant
                sterols such as stigmasterol and sitosterol. His work laid the foundation for the steroid drug
                industry's production of cortisone, other corticosteroids, and birth control pills.

            <h3 id="headline">Later Career and Death</h3>
            <p class="career">Desiring to leave academia, Julian applied for jobs at prominent chemical companies but was repeatedly
                rejected when hiring managers discovered that he was Black. Ultimately, he obtained a position at
                Glidden Company as the lab director. There he invented Aero-Foam, a product that uses soy protein to put
                out oil and gas fires and was widely used in World War II, as well as other soybean-based
                inventions.<br>
                <br>
                Julian continued his biomedical work as well and discovered how to extract sterols from soybean oil and
                synthesize the hormones progesterone and testosterone. He was also lauded for his synthesis of
                cortisone, which became used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
                Julian left Glidden in 1953 and established his own laboratory, Julian Laboratories, in 1954. He sold
                the company in 1961, becoming one of the first Black millionaires, before founding Julian Research
                Institute, a nonprofit organization that he ran for the rest of his life.

                He died of liver cancer on April 19, 1975.
